# 7segment_Display_MQTT_HDC1080
7 Segment LED Display with HDC1080 Sensor and MQTT

Used an Wemos D1 (ESP8266) with Adafruit 7 Segment LED Display and combined it with a HDC1080 temmperature and humidity sensor. The display shows a number received via MQTT (in my case water consumption) and it send the humidity via MQTT to the domotica system (not on the display).

Not really clean code, but it does the trick for now.
